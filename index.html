                    <p>Haruki Murakami has sold millions of books internationally, with his catalogue of work being translated into over 50 different languages. His surrealist novels have captivated readers around the globe, while his collections of short stories and non-fiction offerings demonstrate the stunning diversity in his writing talents.</p>
                    <p>Born in Kyoto in 1949, from a young age Murakami showed a passion for literature, and grew up reading a wide range of books from both Eastern and Western cultures. It is this blend of East meets West that would later set him apart from other, more traditional Japanese writers. In the early 70s, Murakami studied drama at Waseda University in Tokyo where he met his wife, Yoko. He'd always enjoyed the arts, and after he had finished his studies, he settled down to run his own coffee house and jazz bar with Yoko.</p>
                    <p>Up until the age of 29, writing a novel had never even occurred to him. The now infamous story goes, that Murakami went to watch a Baseball match in Jingu Stadium between the Yakult Swallows and the Hiroshima Carp, when Dave Hilton came to bat. Hilton hit a double. It was this precise moment that it suddenly dawned on Murakami that he could write a novel. "Before that", he said, "I didn't write anything. I was just one of those ordinary people. I was running a jazz club, and I didn't create anything at all."</p>
